        <h2><i class="fa fa-file-o"></i> Tips for Submitting Code Samples</h2>
        <p><time datetime="Wed Jul 01 2015 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)">01 Jul 2015</time></p>
        <p>As part of my team’s interview process, we ask our candidates to submit a code sample. We give them a choice of problems, ask them to spend a couple hours, and invite them in for a code review. The exercise itself is not very difficult, but it’s
          a critical step in getting to know a developer.</p>
        <p>After learning from submissions of all levels, I’d like to share some tips and best practices. While I hope they are applicable to any code submission, they are based on my opinions and experiences; results may vary.</p>
        <h3 id="take-your-time">Take your time</h3>
        <p>This can be tricky. Maybe you were asked to spend a couple hours on the assignment, so you could stick to that as a time limit. Perhaps you’re doing this after a long day at work, or you’re staying up late to make the time. Whatever the case may
          be, I’ve seen a lot of submissions where the candidate stuck to a suggested or self-imposed time limit, and it showed.</p>
        <p>If you need to, use version control to commit your work at your time limit, but keep going if you can. Even after you’ve submitted the solution, don’t be afraid to keep working on it. Ask if you’re not sure, but you can probably make changes until
          the day of the interview.</p>
        <h3 id="submit-work-you-re-proud-of">Submit work you’re proud of</h3>
        <p>You should not only spend as much time as you need, but ultimately, you should submit work you’re proud of. Treat it like production code; write tests, refactor, and polish. Not to intimidate you, but this sample should be representative of your
          best work. Don’t worry about whether your best is “good enough.” Focus on doing what you know how to do, to the best of your ability.</p>
        <h3 id="prioritize-maintainability">Prioritize maintainability</h3>
        <p>In general, the most important priority for <em>any</em> code is maintainability. This is especially true when strangers are reading your code. It should be readable and easy to understand. Pay attention to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>consistent formatting - this should be easy, but you would be surprised</li>
          <li>naming things - obviate comments by choosing verbose, descriptive names</li>
          <li>structure &amp; organization - break apart the problem, don’t write one huge function</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="choose-your-preferred-language">Choose your preferred language</h3>
        <p>You may be tempted to choose a language you saw on the job listing. Do so if that’s what the position is about, but often you have a bit of freedom here. You want to demonstrate your skill with a tool, so choose your best tool.</p>
        <h3 id="use-your-preferred-toolset">Use your preferred toolset</h3>
        <p>Whether it’s using a functional library or your favorite testing framework, don’t be afraid to have an opinion and demonstrate it. Part of being a well-rounded developer means not only having a strong grasp of your language, but the ecosystem
          around it.</p>
        <h3 id="dig-in">Dig in</h3>
        <p>Great developers don’t just implement a spec, they build something for someone else to use. Think about the problem space at a deeper level than what the requirements specify. You don’t need to over-engineer the solution, but your understanding
          of the domain will show in both your code and the interview.</p>
        <h3 id="solve-it-yourself">Solve it yourself</h3>
        <p>This may be obvious, but I sometimes hear, “well, if I did this for real, I would research existing solutions.” Yeah, you might, but this is about <em>your</em> abilities. It’s OK to look up docs and APIs, or to use libraries where it makes sense,
          but avoid copying someone else’s design.</p>
        <h3 id="put-it-down-for-a-couple-days">Put it down for a couple days</h3>
        <p>Coming back to your code after the dust has settled will give you a fresh perspective. You’ll spot minor improvements, and potentially, come up with a better design. Your brain has probably been running a subconscious background process since
          you started, so see what it comes up with.</p>
        <h3 id="experiment">Experiment</h3>
        <p>When searching for the best solutions, we often experiment with different designs to find what works. Branch your code and try an alternate approach.</p>
        <p>If something doesn’t work, keep it on a branch. I appreciate hearing what a candidate tried, and how they evolved their design.</p>
        <h3 id="write-a-readme">Write a README</h3>
        <p>You’re usually writing a self-contained, runnable project. Document how to run your code. Also include a description of the problem, especially if it’s hosted somewhere public like GitHub, </p>
        <h3 id="be-ready-to-learn">Be ready to learn</h3>
        <p>Hopefully the interview process includes you in the code review! <em>Invite</em> their feedback and keep a very open mind. This is a learning opportunity in how other engineers reason about code, and with your code no less. It’s OK to volunteer
          improvements and critique yourself, and you may even be asked to.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite questions from a candidate: “are there any more suggestions you could offer me?” It’s <em>really hard</em> to ask for feedback, but this is a strong sign that you’re always looking to improve. Even if you don’t get the job,
          you should walk away a better developer.</p>
        <h3 id="bonus-points">Bonus points</h3>
        <p>These suggestions are not nearly as important as the previous ones, but they could set you apart:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>include a demo/test app</li>
          <li>write build/test/run scripts - and include them in the README</li>
          <li>include accessibility testing, performance benchmarks, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3>
