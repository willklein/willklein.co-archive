<p>Are you an expert? Maybe, but not in everything. The more you know, the more you realize you don’t know, right? Always keep growing. You’ll never turn a corner and run out of things to learn. Help mentor others, but never neglect yourself!</p>
<p>There’s also incredible value in learning how others mentor. There are a handful of people I “study.” They are folks that are really great at something, whether it’s programming, speaking, or mentoring. I pay attention to not only how they work, but the details of how they interact with me. Many of the points mentioned here are derived from those interactions.</p>
<h2 id="consider-their-level">Consider their level</h2>
<p>With a novice, they may need help with programming fundamentals. With an advanced student/intern/first-year developer, they’re probably lacking advanced language features and design patterns. Junior-level or higher? Go nuts.</p>
<h2 id="be-socratic">Be socratic</h2>
<p>Asking questions is easy. Asking questions that tease the knowledge and understanding out of someone, not so easy. This is like an art-form.</p>
<h2 id="make-them-reach">Make them reach</h2>
<p>Once you understand their current abilities, You only want to put things just beyond their grasp.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-showing-off">Avoid showing off</h2>
<p>This isn’t about you, your ideas, or your cleverness. You don’t need to impress your mentee. It’s OK to show them something new, and sometimes explore your own ideas while mentoring, but always ask yourself: are they ready for this? Will it confuse or inspire them?</p>
